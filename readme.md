## Code used in thesis 'Reversed Betting Games'
This evolutionary algorithm and simulation of the Wie is de Mol?-app was used in the Bachelor thesis 'Reversed Betting Games'. I wrote both the code and the thesis. 

### Manual
1. Create a virtual environment.
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages.
1. Run `python evolve.py` to start evolution. You can change the hyperparameters in the .env file.
1. Run `python testData.py` to further test and analyze the strategies found through evolution. Some example data is already present.
